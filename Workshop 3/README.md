This workshop is about exploring singly vs. doubly linked lists and the use of sentinel nodes.

It implements push_front(), push_back(), pop_front() and pop_back() functions for a singly linked list.

The doubly linked list implements sentinel nodes.

The Wiki for this workshop shows analysis for singly linked list.
