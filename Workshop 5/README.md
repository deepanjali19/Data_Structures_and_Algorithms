One of the millenium prize problems is the P VS. NP problem. 

This workshop describes this problem. I have written a report on this topic, which include the understanding of the following questions:

What is meant by Deterministic Turing Machines and Non-Deterministic Turing Machines?

What is meant by P class Problems?

What is meant by NP class Problems?

What is P vs NP?

**The report is under the Wiki section.**
